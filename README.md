# Shannon Entropy calculation, from file or string inputs.

This is a straightforward implementation of a basic Shannon Entropy calculator in Rust.   
[Wikipedia entry on Shannon Entropy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_%28information_theory%29)    

 Reads bytes from files and characters from strings, calculates the result appropriately.    
    
 

## howto
Run from command line, passing in a string or, with the -f flag, a filename.   
-h or --help for help.   
Returns the basic Shannon Entropy in bits.   

Fairly quick; release builds should churn though 100MB+ files in less than a second.   


## examples

Shannon Entropy of the string "1223334444" (also contained in the demo.txt file)   

shannon 1223334444     

or via file:   
shannon -f demo.txt ->    

  character count: 10   
  value: 1.84643934467    
 


## comments:
 Rust seems to have an interesting idiomatic style, although these are still early days and my experience with the language is minimal. The ML heritage certainly is there, as is the C/C++ feel. It's not really a functional programming language but still feels comfortable to someone who writes Clojure (and some OCaml) code most of the time.   
   
Unfortunately this toy-like code doesn't really excercise the innovative ownership concepts & borrow-checker.    



## Prerequisites `

 The Rust language is still undergoing rapid development; this code is circa Rust-alpha-1.0.0
