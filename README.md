## Shannon Entropy calculation, from file or string inputs.

This is a straightforward implementation of a basic Shannon Entropy calculator in Rust.   
[Wikipedia entry on Shannon Entropy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_%28information_theory%29)    

 Reads bytes from files and characters from strings, calculates the result appropriately.    
    

## howto
Run from command line, passing in a string or, with the -f flag, a filename.   
-h or --help for help.   
Returns the basic Shannon Entropy in bits.   

Fairly quick; release builds should churn though 100MB+ files in less than a second.   


## examples

Shannon Entropy of the string "1223334444" (also contained in the demo.txt file)   

shannon 1223334444     

or via file:   
shannon -f demo.txt ->    

  character count: 10   
  value: 1.84643934467    
 

## performance  
Just for kicks, here is a quick speed comparison of this code to a mostly similar [OCaml version](https://github.com/jme/shannon) I had previously written:     


target file: rust-nightly_.tar.gz (~100MB)   

   ----------------------------
style A: using HashMap (Rust) / Hashtbl (OCaml) for the bins   

shannon-rust (release build): 20.73s   
shannon-ocaml               : 48.7s    

   ----------------------------
style B: bins as mutable arrays  

shannon-rust (release build): 0.510s   
shannon-ocaml               : 2.560s    


There is a stale joke to the effect that speed-run optimizations of code written in FP style lead right back to imperative-land. But I kind-of did do this to the OCaml code, whittling down the file reader into something mutable. Hopefully not so much Crude Hackery as 'pragmatic FP'.  

Even so, for *this* quasi-toy program the Rust version(s) run at 2-5x the speed of *similar* OCaml version(s).  



## comments:
 Rust seems to have an interesting idiomatic style, although these are still early days and my experience with the language is minimal. The ML heritage certainly is there, as is the C/C++ feel. It's not really a functional programming language but still feels comfortable to someone who writes Clojure (and some OCaml) code most of the time.  And it's fast.  
   
Unfortunately this toy-like code doesn't really excercise traits or the innovative ownership concepts & borrow-checker.  Obviously I need to write some more Rust code :-)   



## Prerequisites `

 The Rust language is still undergoing rapid development; this code is circa Rust-alpha-1.0.0
