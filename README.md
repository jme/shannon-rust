# Shannon Entropy calculation, from file or string inputs.

 Includes a few source variations on file-read and binning operations, and uses the fastest variation.  


 
## Notes:  
 Reads bytes from files and characters from strings, calculates the result appropriately.    
 The Rust language is still undergoing rapid development; this code is circa Rust-alpha-1.0.0   

## comments:
 Rust seems to have an interesting idiomatic style, although these are still early days and my experience with the language is minimal. The ML heritage certainly is there, as is the C/C++ feel. It's not really a functional programming language but still feels comfortable to someone who writes Clojure (and some OCaml) code most of the time.   
   
Unfortunately this toy-like code doesn't really excercise the innovative ownership concepts & borrow-checker.
